* Introduction

This is my solution to the PacMan problem orginally described in the [[README.original.org][README.md]].

* Setup
** Make
In order to automate things and to make things simpler for the developers I use the good ol' make command, available in most *nix systems.


** Docker
In order to execute the application without polluting your system with gems or ruby versions, I have created a docker container that basically let you do everything inside.

To build the container you can run:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
make build
#+END_SRC


Or if you run to build the container and run a shell inside you can do:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
make
#+END_SRC


* TestShell

The testshell is the way you can access the container without building it again, and you can do that by running:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
make testshell
#+END_SRC
