* Setup
** Make
In order to automate things and to make things simpler for the developers I use the good ol' ```make``` command, available in most *nix systems.


** Docker
In order to execute the application without polluting your system with gems or ruby versions, I have created a docker container that basically let you do everything inside.

To build the container you can run:

```
make build
```

Or if you run to build the container and run a shell inside you can do:

```
make
```

* TestShell
The testshell is the way you can access the container without building it again, and you can do that by running:

```
make testshell
```
